## Design

Decor Dreams's design is intentionally crafted to be simple and clean.

### Color Scheme

Decor Dreams' color palette showcases tones of green and gold, cultivating a contemporary and chic aesthetic that harmonizes seamlessly with the hero call-out image on the homepage.

In my CSS file, I employed variables to define colors and consistently applied them across the entire stylesheet. It enables easy color updates throughout the website by modifying the color once in the variable, maintaining consistency across the design.

Great care was taken to establish a good contrast between background colors and text at all times to ensure maximum user accessibility, confirmed through the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

The color palette was generated using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.
